Because the days are becoming very long and idle, Genji departed for that small fenced house, going under the cover of the heavily-misted dusk. When he let the servants return and peeked with Koremitsu, they saw that just in the west direction, there was a nun who was humbly placing a small Buddhist statue and praying. It seemed like she raised the blind a little and offered flowers.
The nun, who was leaning on a pillar, sitting, and reading the sutra which she had put on the armrest, did not look like an ordinary person. She was about over forty; her face was very white and elegant; although her body was slim, her face was chubby. Seeing the end of her hair, which was cut to the height of her eyebrows in a seemingly beautiful way, Genji was deeply moved and said, “rather than being long, this is also fairly superb and fashionable.”
There were two neat adults, and then, children were going in and out, playing.
Inside, Genji saw that one girl, who seemed to be around ten, wearing a well-worn white underrobe, a *yamabuki*-coloured robe and such, was running here.
It would be inappropriate to compare her with the other children he had seen, and he could see that she would become an extremely beautiful woman.
She stood with her hair, like an opened fan, swinging in the air, and her face rubbed deliberately in red.

The nun said, “what's going on here! Do you want to fight the young children?” When the nun raised her head, he saw that there were some resemblances between them, and thought, “it seems that the girl is her child.”

Murasaki said, “Inuki released the sparrow baby, even though I had placed it inside the basket!” She felt very regretful.

This sitting adult said, “she must find it very unpleasant that she always gets scolded after she carelessly does such things. In which direction has it gone? Just when it had finally become very cute! It would be terrible if it gets spotted by crows”, and stood up and left to find the sparrow.
Her hair was loose and very long; she seemed like an agreeable person.
The *menoto* who people called Shonagon must be the caretaker of this child.

The nun said, “oh, my, how childish! She is so fond of sparrows that she does not care at all about my life, which could end today or tomorrow. Even though I always tell her ‘this is a sin’. How unpleasant.”

The nun said, “come here!” and Murasaki came and knelt down.
